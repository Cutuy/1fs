Effective knowledge finding > Personal organization vs public view of directory

## Objective
[vview-o1 ✔] Provide a different view for an existing directory at another place

## Key Results
[vview-o1-kr1 ✔] Project a hierarchical directory with arbitrary in-mem data that supports placeholder enumeration
[vview-o1-kr2 ✔] An exisiting directory is "captured" by 1fs and then projected
[vview-o1-kr3 ✔] The file data, upon requested, is "projected" from its original location

## Next (12/28)
Refactor required to correctly address diff between "file path" from projfs and win32
Code quality update
(later) Encapsulate in a class/lib that runs as a console app
